# python

Hello,

This is an analysis of a budget and the results of a political campaign using python.

In this repository you'll find the folders for PyBank and PyPoll. Inside, you'll find the code in the "main" file, the file with the raw data in the "resources" folder, and the output file in the "analysis" folder.

Thank you,

Matthew Berry
